# h34a

We are in a hurry now'a days, not like we can write words with more than a few letters, because that is really really anoying.  
So to make it easier, we just replace all the letters in between the first and last letter in words with a number, the specific number
of letters that was removed! Smart? Yes, very smart.

This package allows you to convert a word (or even many words!) in this way, something that people have waited on for years and years.

## What's with the name?

Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia is a phobia of long words, and we all have this, every last one of us. So the name plays on that word
(h <34 letters> a).

## License?

I was intending to monetize on this package, as I know it will be one of the most downloaded packages in npm history, but after long consideration
I decided to release it under the wtfpl license so that everyone can use it!

DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE
